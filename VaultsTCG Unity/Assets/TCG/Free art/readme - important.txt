If you want to use this art for your game, you have to credit the authors. Credit = the name of the folder with the art.

Most of the art was donated specifically for TCG Maker (Jessica Kings, KepKep, Mike Capprotti) , it can't be found anywhere else on the web. Others I handpicked from various cc-by sites. Enjoy!

For the card frame and icons (made by me), check "Photoshop templates" folder. They can be used without attribution, but I would appreciate if you credit me: "Melang for TCG Maker". :)
